-- Creating views in MySQL serves multiple purposes and brings several benefits:

-- Simplify Complex Queries: Views help break down complex SQL queries into more manageable and readable chunks by abstracting the complexities.

-- Reusability: Once a view is created, you can reuse it multiple times without writing the same complex query repeatedly.

-- Security: Views can be used to restrict user access to specific columns or rows of data, enhancing data security. You can grant permissions on views rather than on the underlying tables.

-- Data Abstraction: Views can provide a different representation of the data, which may be more relevant for a particular user's needs, without altering the underlying table structure.

-- Performance Optimization: In some cases, using views can optimize performance by pre-defining certain queries, though this depends on the specific context and database management system.

-- Maintenance: Views can simplify database maintenance by providing a consistent interface, even if the underlying table structure changes.

-- For example, if you have a complicated query joining multiple tables, you can create a view and query the view instead, making your SQL code cleaner and easier to manage.

-- Great! Let's dive into managing views in MySQL. Here's a simple guide to get you started:

-- Creating a View
-- To create a view, you use the CREATE VIEW statement followed by the view name and the SELECT query that defines the view's content. For example:
CREATE VIEW customer_order_details AS
SELECT 
    c.C_ID AS customer_id,
    c.C_NAME AS customer_name,
    c.C_CONTACT AS customer_contact_no,
    o.O_ID AS order_id,
    p.P_NAME AS product_name,
    p.P_PRICE AS product_price
FROM 
    customer c 
JOIN 
    orders o ON c.C_ID = o.C_ID
JOIN
    product p ON o.P_ID = p.P_ID
WHERE 
    p.P_PRICE > 2000;
    
    
-- Querying a View
-- Once a view is created, you can query it just like a table. For example:
SELECT * FROM customer_order_details;

-- Updating a View
-- If you need to modify an existing view, you can use the ALTER VIEW statement:
ALTER VIEW customer_order_details AS
SELECT 
    c.C_ID AS customer_id,
    c.C_NAME AS customer_name,
    c.C_CONTACT AS customer_contact_no,
    o.O_ID AS order_id,
    p.P_NAME AS product_name,
    p.P_PRICE AS product_price
FROM 
    customer c 
JOIN 
    orders o ON c.C_ID = o.C_ID
JOIN
    product p ON o.P_ID = p.P_ID
WHERE 
    p.P_PRICE > 1500;  -- Adjusted the price filter as an example
    
    
-- Dropping a View
-- To remove a view from the database, use the DROP VIEW statement:
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS customer_order_details;

-- Checking View Definitions
-- To see the definition of a view, you can use the SHOW CREATE VIEW statement:
SHOW CREATE VIEW customer_order_details;

-- This will display the SQL statement that was used to create the view.

-- Renaming a View
-- MySQL does not have a direct RENAME VIEW statement, but you can achieve this by creating a new view with the desired name and dropping the old one:
CREATE VIEW new_view_name AS SELECT * FROM customer_order_details;
DROP VIEW customer_order_details;

-- By understanding these operations, you can effectively manage views in your MySQL database. Views can be a powerful tool for simplifying complex queries, enhancing security, and improving data abstraction.
